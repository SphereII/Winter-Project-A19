  The simulation tick rate in hz, if you have performance issues you can try lowering this.
  NOTE: Going lower than 20 may cause issues due to accuracy.

  Halts the simulation if no players are on the server, set to false for a continious simulation.

  Makes the simulation persistent, if you want to wipe/restart the simulation there are two choices:
  1: The plugin has a command to reset the simulation: "walkersim reset"
  2: You can delete the simulation data located at your save path named WalkerSim.bin
  NOTE: Turning this off will always restart the simulation whenever the server restarts.

  <!-- 
	Divides the entire map into zones, the zone divider is used on each axis (xy).
	Offline zombies will use these zones as their goal targets, once a specific zone is 
	reached with a local offset they will pick a new zone that is close by.

  <!--
	Chance the offline zombie will travel to a POI rather than a world zone.
	This increases the amount of zombies nearby POIs to make exploration a bit more intense.
	Valid values are from 0.0 - 1.0 representing a chance where 1 is 100%

	Population density per square kilometer, this parameter drives the amount of zombies per map size.
	Some examples (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density):
	Increasing the population density will also make the game a lot harder, be careful here.

	Enables the view server allowing the WalkerSimViewer to connect and inspect the entire simulation.
	NOTE: You should be careful enabling this. The protocol is not efficient and is mainly used for debugging
	purpose only.
