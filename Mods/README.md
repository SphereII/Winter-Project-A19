War3zuk Alpha 19 AIO OverHaul

What this Mod is about, This Mod changes around 90% of the Total game Mechanics in the sense of Code, It adds many weapons All of which have been
bought from various stores to try to get the best looking and playing Mod I can manage, Its constantly being worked on and improved and should
always be kept upto date with the latest version of the main core game, The AIO also adds many Blocks and Different items that require abit
more learning in order to understand how it all works, A good example of this is the main weapons are no longer repaired using the default
repair kits but instead use 4 Custom made varients that are crafted on the player to do with each type of gun.. The link above explains the
Mod in much more detail.. Some of My Original Modlets that were used to create this AIO are as follows.. Around 20 or so more have been added
directly to the AIO that cant be made into Modlets due to them needing certain bits of code from the AIO so would cause Conflicts..
