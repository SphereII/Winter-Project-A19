"statement_-911053284","A lot of survivors have come and gone through my door, each telling a tale or two. Some are a lot stranger than others. What's your tale? Maybe I can help."
"statement_1825662454","A scream? Was it by any chance a little girl in a white gown?"
"statement_570755","Other survivors have called them different things, like scramers and witches. One guy even said he was sure she was a scout for the undead, if you can believe that!"
"statement_-934124723","Hmm, that'd be a first for me. Sorry, I can't help you with that."
"statement_1709391836","Well, it's not just a single her. From what I gather, they were in a large choir before the apcalypse happend. From the audio cds I've heard, they sounded amazing. People from all around would come and hear them sing."
"statement_-1964541540","What do you mean? People still come when they sing? There's no people anymore..."
"statement_2042917692","Wow. Really? One could say the girls had life long friends..."
"statement_-1296294849","Hallucinations seem to be the most common thing to experience from it. Things move that shouldn't move. One guy even said it was a shocking experience!"
"statement_-1186374644","It'll pass on its own. Just be very careful when you are out and about. even though you know they are hallucinations, a single mistep could end your story."
"statement_113540401","I'm not here to judge. I'm just telling you what others have told me. Some of these survivors may be a big unhinged in the apocalypse, but enough have told me similar stories for me to believe it."
"statement_1278125788","That's fine. I'm not forcing you too."
"statement_696519040","And what do you mean by that?"
"statement_-1817427719","Well, alright. Thank you for fixing it."
"statement_-425807045","At least I have hammers. You won't get any of mine anymore."
"statement_219039082","Ha! Very funny. I don't get a lot of humour around here. Most people that come through my door was just wise crackers. But not you. Here's a gift for being so witty!"
"statement_1590747344","A video? Can you describe it?"
"statement_-1609352553","That sounds like you watched Samara Morgan's video."
"statement_-763794064","As the story goes, Samara was adopted by a Richard and Anna Morgan. Shortly after she went to live with them, strange things started happened to the family and the farm. A lot of people blamed poor Samara, but she was just a little girl."
"statement_-1138598353","Samara had a diary, I do know that much. Her adopted father Richard, after Samara disappeared and his wife jumped off a cliff, tried to destroy, then hid the diary. If you could find that, we'd be closer to figuring it out."
"statement_-111266730","A deranged survivor came through here a few months ago, ranting and raving aobut storage crate he found. He kept muttering about Moesko Island. Start your search there."
"statement_632825439","You knuckle head."
"statement_-1601191281","I understand. You gotta get your affairs in order. Good luck."
"statement_-317566110","Thank you. Let me take a look at it."
"statement_-1845266020","The book is hard to follow. Lots of scribbles and hen scratches at the start. As you go further, though, you see that the writing gets better. There is even a few pages about her own adoption. How would she know that?"
"statement_1243736811","There's not much here, actually. Says she was born at a nun's hospital and that she was put up for adoption after her own mother tried to kill her. The mother was committed to an insane facility and she was placed for adoption."
"statement_-1563528298","I'm guessing Anna and Richard would have told her at some point. But she was pretty young up to her diappearance."
"statement_-83934518","You got me on that one. I have no idea why they would ever tell a child that."
"statement_83608389","There's a woman's name here: Evelyn. I wonder if that might have been her mother. There's another name too, Burke. Maybe her father? I wonder what happened to him."
"statement_655574936","Samara disappeared many many years ago, when she was very young. I doubt she's alive, or anyone else from her past."
"statement_786933789","Seems she absolutely adored Anna, and that Anna loved her back. She didn't write much about Richard. There's a heart around a few pictures of horses and Richard. Maybe she loved them both."
"statement_816304593","There's scribbles about Anna's other children, but nothing really talks about them. Anna eventually committed suicide by jumping off a cliff. See this picture of the cliff?"
"statement_-1432676731","You are right. The timelines in this diary don't make sense. Samara was last seen during a family trip to Shelter Mountain. I have the newspaper article around here somewhere. I'll see if I can find it."
"statement_778325609","Oh I found it! Yes, here it is. Local girl disappeared on family trip to Shelter Mountain Inn. Says the search was called off a day after she was reported missing. Doesn't seem like anyone was interested in finding her."
"statement_2100192137","This other article I have says that things on Moesko Island has been improving since the date of her disappearance."
"statement_-1610564841","Not much. Seems like she thought he loved the horses more than her, and blamed her for the troubles. I don't think they got along very well."
"statement_341531454","The newspaper article said that they lost 36 horses in one season. They ran off into the water and drowned themselves. Maybe he thought she was bringing bad luck to the farm. They never found out why the horses did that."
"statement_1371118153","Let's talk about more about this Samara business. I've been looking up newspaper articles that I've been storing for years to try to get more information for you."
"statement_2008929533","There's a strange fascination with the horses. I'm not sure if she loved them or hated them."
"statement_507174621","Samara's memories are really strange. She did not have a lot of posessions, but she must have felt really strongly about the ones she did have."
"statement_358750944","Samara drew, or really, etched, a series of photos in her diary. I don't understand what they mean though. She drew a barn for sure, and what looks like some kind of church tower? Do you think these are from her past? Nothing like this would have existed on Moesko Island."
"statement_926736863","As I said, there's fascination with horses. I'm just not sure if it was a possitive one or a negative one. Richard is strongly linked to the horses, and I don't think she liked him very much. Have you seen any strange horses around? If so, I'd start with them."
"statement_843620287","Good luck. I'm not sure exactly what to do with them. I just can't tell if she liked them or not."
"statement_277047307","Suit yourself. I've  heard Am I Gone Funerals is still taking clients."
"statement_-1653767314","The only thing she mentioned was her hair brush and her simple white dress. Keep an eye out for them."
"statement_310153262","See if you can find some of these pictures."
"statement_207420822","Gosh darn it. I knew when we started this journey, we would learn some unpleasant things. But this story... Samara's story... I've been doing a lot of research on this."
"statement_604703902","She hated the horses. They drove her absolutely crazy! You see, Richard put her in the barn to live, to get her away from him and Anna! That idiot abandoned that little girl, and hid her away from the world."
"statement_-641915930","Horses aren't quiet. I guess their movements, breathing, and random noises kept her awake. That's why there's several pages in her diary that's focused on her not sleeping. It probably weakened what small hold she had on her sanity."
"statement_-1588651119","Samara was not a normal girl. Richard swore that Anna was being subjected and haunted by images in her head. If I had to guess, Samara could send images directly into people's heads! Crazy, I know. Probably drove them mad, if she could do that to horses too."
"statement_995560205","The better question is... what is Samara?"
"statement_-511015206","The last time was seen was when they went up to Shelter Mountain Inn. That's not too far away from here, although there probably isn't much left. I'll show you where its at. It's been a long time though, but you may have find some answers there."
"statement_1792478159","Good luck. And be careful."
"statement_1047462225","You found her. She was at the bottom of the well this entire time? I'll... I'll put her to rest for you."
"statement_-1028949693","From what you've told me, yes. Probably Anna. What a heart wrenching story. Anna killed her daughter."
"statement_-1054903595","That must mean that Samara was still alive when Anna closed the lid on her. I can't even imagine... trapped at the bottom of the well and left for dead."
"statement_531574442","If Samara was sending images to Anna's head, that may have been the only way she thought would stop them. Considering Anna killed herself not long afterwards, either the visions didn't stop, or she felt remorse."
"statement_-64306763","I'd say not. Either driven mad by Samara or driven mad by murdering her child."
"statement_-824755831","7 Days, I bet. She was alive at the bottom of that well for 7 days in the dark."
"statement_808268362","I don't have an answer for that one. The video was created after she died. It's like it's telling her story, but in such a distorted way its not really clear."
"statement_759720541","We don't know what Samara was or is. She led a toturred life. She wanted to be loved, but couldn't control her thoughts."
"statement_-1960440832","I like to believe there's some good in everyone, but you may be right. She may not have wanted to control them. But she did want us to know about her."
"statement_1929307888","Samara Morgan is dead. She died years ago at the bottom of that well. Whatever was inside of that little girl, however, did not die with her."
"statement_-1778677533","It looks like it. You are still cursed it seems. We thought destroying the things that she loved and hated would let her soul free and leave. I think we were wrong. We are very wrong."
"statement_-2054310279","Yes, she is."
"statement_-1114866312","Run? No, you wouldn't be able to out run her. She'll get you. But I don't think it was wasted time.  You dug into her past and together we pieced together aspects of her life. I think that's what she wanted. She wanted her story to be out."
"statement_-586293420","If her goal was to let people know her story, maybe that's what we need to do. Let more people know."
"statement_1491270808","I don't think that would work. She already has the diary."
"statement_272570392","Obviously it isn't. You watched the video, then we worked toge..... wait.. you watched the video. What if the video is the key?"
"statement_1345208007","She wants more people to watch the video! It tells her story through her eyes and thoughts. That's what is important. We need to copy the video tape."
"statement_1790083874","I have a broken duplicator here. If you can find me some mechanical parts, I might be able to fix it."
"statement_335517511","That's great. Let me take them and see if I can fix it."
"statement_-1547291539","I got the DVD working. If you have the DVD, I can make a copy."
"statement_-443382724","Thank you. Let me make a copy of it."
"statement_258652666","Come back when you have it. If I don't see you again, I just want to let you know I enjoyed our time together, and I'm sorry this happened to you."
"statement_843248462","You are welcome. I'm sorry you had to experience. I've made a copy of the DVD, and I shipped it out to someone I know."
"statement_1450290941","Let's not get into any sort of details. What we just did is not good karma, and I hope they either figure it out, and their soul finds peace."
"statement_305002939","No. Samara did. Best not to think about it."
"responseID_-2088969424","Something strange happened to me."
"response_1374956358","I heard a loud scream. It hurt my ears."
"response_1277759608","Never mind. I don't want to talk about it."
"response_1949193699","Yes! It was a little girl."
"responseID_-2044119719","No, it wasn't from a girl."
