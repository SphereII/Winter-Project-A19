# WinterProject-A19
Welcome to the Winterween Project by sphereii and xyth, the unholy combination of Winter Project and the ancient Valoween!

Not wanting to miss an alpha, we've combined two of the most dramatic mods into a single mod for Alpha 19.

Steel your nerves. Steady your hands. Keep your wits about you, and you just may survive Winterween...

Thank you to the following Modlet creators who helped shape out the world with their modlets:
	JaxTeller718 for his Zombie hand adjustments, increased biome zombies, and wandering hordes.
	Riles for Riles' HUD Plus UI
	Ragsy for the custom vehicle.

Recommended: 12G of RAM or higher.

Special thanks goes to Mumpfy for his texturing work.
